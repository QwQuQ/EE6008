The current version is only available for Android phones:
Before connecting, turn on the power of the balanced mobile robot and turn on the Bluetooth of the phone.

In this APP, click "Start Scanning" to begin scanning for available Bluetooth devices. 

Click "Select Bluetooth Device" to open a list of available devices and complete the selection by clicking on the desired device. 

If the connection is successful, the status bar text changes from "Disconnected" to "Connected," and the "Disconnect" button becomes enabled. 

Clicking this button will disconnect the device, and the status bar text will revert to "Disconnected."

Once the Bluetooth connection is established, the five function buttons can be used to control the balancing mobile robot to perform the corresponding actions: 
"Move Forward," "Move Backward," "Turn Right," "Turn Left," and "Stop."
